## Creating a Buffer Object

### Description

The `create` function creates a buffer object in an OpenCL context. This buffer object can be used to store data that will be processed by an OpenCL device.

```zig
pub fn create(
    context: Context,
    flags: MemFlags,
    size: usize,
    host_ptr: ?*anyopaque,
) OpenCLError!Mem;
```

### Parameters

-   **context**: The `Context` in which the buffer object will be created.
-   **flags**: A bit-field used to specify allocation and usage information about the buffer memory object being created. These values can be obtained from the `MemFlag` struct which contains mappings to OpenCL C enums. For example:
    -   `CL_MEM_WRITE_ONLY` -> `write_only`
    -   `CL_MEM_READ_WRITE` -> `read_write`
-   **size**: The size in bytes of the buffer memory object to be allocated.
-   **host_ptr**: A pointer to the buffer data that may already be allocated by the application. The size of the buffer that `host_ptr` points to must be greater than or equal to `size` bytes.

### Error Handling

The function uses Zig's error handling features to manage potential OpenCL errors. If the function call to `clCreateBuffer` does not return `CL_SUCCESS`, an error is thrown. Possible errors include:

-   `"invalid_context"`: The specified context is not valid.
-   `"invalid_value"`: Values specified in flags are not valid as defined in the Memory Flags table.
-   `"invalid_buffer_size"`: Size is 0, or if size is greater than `CL_DEVICE_MAX_MEM_ALLOC_SIZE` for all devices in context.
-   `"invalid_host_ptr"`: If `host_ptr` is NULL and `CL_MEM_USE_HOST_PTR` or `CL_MEM_COPY_HOST_PTR` are set in flags or if `host_ptr` is not NULL but `CL_MEM_COPY_HOST_PTR` or `CL_MEM_USE_HOST_PTR` are not set in flags.
-   `"mem_object_allocation_failure"`: There is a failure to allocate memory for the buffer object.
-   `"out_of_resources"`: There is a failure to allocate resources required by the OpenCL implementation on the device.
-   `"out_of_host_memory"`: There is a failure to allocate resources required by the OpenCL implementation on the host.

## Creating a Sub Buffer

### Description

The `create_sub_buffer` function creates a sub-buffer object from an existing buffer. This allows a portion of a buffer's memory to be used separately as a new buffer object. The function uses specific flags and a buffer creation type to control how the sub-buffer is created.

```zig
pub fn createSubBuffer(
    buffer: Mem,
    flags: MemFlags,
    buffer_create_type: CreateType,
    buffer_create_info: *anyopaque,
) OpenCLError!Mem;
```

### Parameters

-   **buffer**: The existing `Mem` buffer from which the sub-buffer will be created.
-   **flags**: Memory allocation flags defining how the sub-buffer will be used (e.g., read/write permissions).
-   **buffer_create_type**: Specifies the type of sub-buffer to create, from the `CreateType` enum.
-   **buffer_create_info**: A pointer to a structure that defines how the sub-buffer is created. This can vary depending on the sub-buffer type.

### Error Handling

The function uses Zig's error handling features to manage potential OpenCL errors. If `clCreateSubBuffer` does not return `CL_SUCCESS`, an error is thrown. Possible errors include:

-   `"invalid_mem_object"`: The buffer provided is not a valid memory object.
-   `"invalid_value"`: Invalid values for buffer creation info or flags.
-   `"mem_object_allocation_failure"`: Failure to allocate the sub-buffer.

-   `"out_of_host_memory"`: Failure to allocate resources required by the OpenCL implementation on the host.
-   `"invalid_buffer_size"`: The specified buffer size is not valid.
-   `"misaligned_sub_buffer_offset"`: The sub-buffer offset is misaligned.

## Mapping Buffers

### Description

The `map` function maps a buffer into the host address space, allowing the application to read or write directly to the buffer. This function supports both blocking and non-blocking map operations and leverages Zig's `comptime` to provide a template-like mechanism for different pointer types.

```zig
pub fn map(
    comptime T: type,
    command_queue: CommandQueue,
    buffer: Mem,
    blocking_map: bool,
    map_flags: MapFlags,
    offset: usize,
    size: usize,
    event_wait_list: ?[]const Event,
    event: ?*Event,
) OpenCLError!T;
```

### Parameters

-   **T**: The type of the pointer to be returned. Must be a pointer type (e.g., `*T`, `[]T`, or `[*]T`).
-   **command_queue**: The `CommandQueue` in which the map command will be queued. The OpenCL context associated with `command_queue` and `buffer` must be the same.
-   **buffer**: The `Mem` buffer to be mapped.
-   **blocking_map**: A boolean indicating if the map operation is blocking or non-blocking.
-   **map_flags**: A bit-field specifying the map operation. Values for constructing this bit-field can be obtained from the `MapFlag` struct. Possible values include:
    -   `CL_MAP_READ` -> `read`
    -   `CL_MAP_WRITE` -> `write`
-   **offset**: The offset in bytes in the buffer object to map.
-   **size**: The size in bytes of the region in the buffer object to map.
-   **event_wait_list**: A pointer to an array of `Event` that need to complete before this command can be executed. If `event_wait_list` is null, no events need to complete before this command.
-   **event**: A pointer to an `Event` that will identify this map command and can be used to query or queue a wait for this command to complete. If `event` is null, no event will be created.

### Error Handling

The function uses Zig's error handling features to manage potential OpenCL errors. If the function call to `clEnqueueMapBuffer` does not return `CL_SUCCESS`, an error is thrown. Possible errors include:

-   `"invalid_command_queue"`: The command queue is not valid.
-   `"invalid_context"`: The context associated with the command queue and buffer objects is not valid or not the same.
-   `"invalid_mem_object"`: The buffer is not a valid memory object.
-   `"invalid_value"`: The offset, size, or map flags are invalid.
-   `"invalid_event_wait_list"`: The event wait list is invalid.
-   `"misaligned_sub_buffer_offset"`: A sub-buffer object is not aligned correctly.
-   `"mem_copy_overlap"`: The source and destination buffers overlap.
-   `"mem_object_allocation_failure"`: There is a failure to allocate memory for the buffer objects.
-   `"out_of_resources"`: There is a failure to allocate resources required by the OpenCL implementation on the device.
-   `"out_of_host_memory"`: There is a failure to allocate resources required by the OpenCL implementation on the host.
-   `"invalid_operation"`: The map operation is invalid due to overlapping regions being mapped for writing or due to the buffer being created with certain flags.

## Unmapping Buffers

### Description

The `unmap` function unmaps a previously mapped buffer from the host address space. This function completes any operations on the mapped region and makes the buffer available for other operations in OpenCL. This function leverages Zig's `comptime` to provide a template-like mechanism for different pointer types.

```zig
pub fn unmap(
    comptime T: type,
    command_queue: CommandQueue,
    buffer: Mem,
    mapped_ptr: T,
    event_wait_list: ?[]const Event,
    event: ?*Event,
) OpenCLError!void;
```

### Parameters

-   **T**: The type of the pointer to be unmapped. Must be a pointer type (e.g., `*T`, `[]T`, or `[*]T`).
-   **command_queue**: The `CommandQueue` in which the unmap command will be queued. The OpenCL context associated with `command_queue` and `buffer` must be the same.
-   **buffer**: The `Mem` buffer to be unmapped.
-   **mapped_ptr**: The pointer to the mapped region in the host address space.
-   **event_wait_list**: A pointer to an array of `Event` that need to complete before this command can be executed. If `event_wait_list` is null, no events need to complete before this command.
-   **event**: A pointer to an `Event` that will identify this unmap command and can be used to query or queue a wait for this command to complete. If `event` is null, no event will be created.

### Error Handling

The function uses Zig's error handling features to manage potential OpenCL errors. If the function call to `clEnqueueUnmapMemObject` does not return `CL_SUCCESS`, an error is thrown. Possible errors include:

-   `"invalid_command_queue"`: The command queue is not valid.
-   `"invalid_mem_object"`: The buffer is not a valid memory object.
-   `"invalid_value"`: The mapped pointer is not a valid pointer returned by `clEnqueueMapBuffer` or `clEnqueueMapImage`.
-   `"invalid_event_wait_list"`: The event wait list is invalid.
-   `"out_of_resources"`: There is a failure to allocate resources required by the OpenCL implementation on the device.
-   `"out_of_host_memory"`: There is a failure to allocate resources required by the OpenCL implementation on the host.
-   `"invalid_context"`: The context associated with the command queue and buffer objects is not valid or not the same.

## Retaining a Memory Object

### Description

The `retain` function increments the reference count of a memory object. This function is used to ensure that the memory object remains valid even if other references to it are released.

```zig
pub fn retain(buffer: Mem) OpenCLError!void;
```

### Parameters

-   **buffer**: The `Mem` memory object to be retained.

### Error Handling

The function uses Zig's error handling features to manage potential OpenCL errors. If the function call to `clRetainMemObject` does not return `CL_SUCCESS`, an error is thrown. Possible errors include:

-   `"invalid_mem_object"`: The buffer is not a valid memory object.
-   `"out_of_resources"`: There is a failure to allocate resources required by the OpenCL implementation on the device.
-   `"out_of_host_memory"`: There is a failure to allocate resources required by the OpenCL implementation on the host.

## Releasing a Memory Object

### Description

The `release` function decrements the reference count of a memory object. When the reference count becomes zero, the memory object is deleted. This function ensures that resources are properly released when they are no longer needed.

```zig
pub fn release(buffer: Mem) void;
```

### Parameters

-   **buffer**: The `Mem` memory object to be released.
